# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description
Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities can't access their website.

Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section.

## User Story
AS A marketing agency  
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards  
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines  

## Acceptence Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards  
WHEN I view the source code  
THEN I find semantic HTML elements  
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements  
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning  
WHEN I view the image elements  
THEN I find accessible alt attributes  
WHEN I view the heading attributes  
THEN they fall in sequential order  
WHEN I view the title element  
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
