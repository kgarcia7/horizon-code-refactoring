#HTML Module 1 Challenge

## User Story
As a boot camp student
I want to achieve all the acceptence criteria listed in the class repo for module 1 
So that I can successfully accomplish this week's challenge of refactoring existing code to improve web accessibility and optimize search engines for a marketing agency

## Acceptence Criteria
GIVEN the starter code and assests provided in the class repo
WHEN I view the source code and assests 
THEN I can make changes using class and web resources to improve web accessibility to the starter code by incorporating semantic HTML elements, re-structing HTML elements that follow logical structure, adding accessible alt and heading attributes, and including a descriptive title element
